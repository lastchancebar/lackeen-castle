 # Testing
## Code Validation
 The Lackeen Castle website has to be thoroughly tested.

 I conducted the following tests
* HTML validation   through the W3c HTML checker. It turned up two minor errors which are fixed.

* CSS validation through w3c jigsaw validator. The same story applied.  A couple of small errors , one testing my knowledge of form elements and one of padding. I am particularly proud of this as my first attempt at validating my CSS turned upmore than 2 errors.! I have copied code for the CSS validation tick into my index.html page.

* Lighthouse  - the website scored 91 overall  with a LOT of pointers for making a better website. There is a lot of useful information in the report which I plan to study and learn from it. It is a great devtool.
