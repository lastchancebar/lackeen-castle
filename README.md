# Wireframes

As I was not familiar enough with Balsamiq, I did not persist with them in planning my project, but this project journey has taught me the value of planning with wireframes and I will do so in future and save a lot of time.

# Site Structure

Lackeen Castle website has 5 pages. The <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/index.html)>home page</a> is the default landing page. The <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/castledef2.html)>castle defences,<a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/stowemissal.html)>Stowe Missal</a> and <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/contact.html)>Contact/guided tours pages are accessable from the navigation menu. There is also a <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/formdestination.html)>form destination/thank you</a> page which loads when the reader submits the contact/booking form.

## Design choices

* ### Typography

I chose fonts which I thought conveyed history -'Eczar' for headings and 'PT+ Serif' for content, both on Google fonts which is shown at top of CSS file. Both fonts fall back to serif so they complement one another. As serif fonts it would not be difficult to substitute them in the event of one or both not being available .
 

 * ### Colour Scheme

 I chose #00008b Navy blue for background to inspire history and learning.
 I chose Bisque - a warm cream-white, for text, a good contrast to the navy background. Blue snd white arethe local GAA club colours , which wouldn't be lost on local viewers of the website.
 I also used a dark red with 0.7 opacity for information bubbles which were on top of images.
 Coral was used to highlight clickable links in content. It was a bit too bright but more visible thatn several yellows I tried.

 I didn't use colorpicker but will do in future.

 One of the weaknesses lightouse flagged was that there was a lack of contrast in my my headings which were overlaid on pictures. I was able to back them with a .7 opacity ark red box but as screen sizes went down, this box had to go.

 # Features

## Home page
 
This page introduces the castle, its age, owners, defence features aand a manuscript that was found in the walls. There are links in the content to the defence page and Stowe missal page which invite the user to explore the website further.


to visit the castle a map and directions are set out.

# Defences

This page is educational, inviting the reader to look more closely at the stone walls of the castle and to reflect of life in medieval times in Ireland.  Defence features described in this page in fact-boxes.
* ### Fact-boxes

These boxes contain information on narrow windows, machicolations, and the  murder hole secreted above the door of the castle. This page is to whet the readers' interest and also as a learning tool, might encourage school visits to the area. I think this would appeal to gamers/ Game of Thrones fan-types and pre-teen  boys!

# Stowe Missal

This relatively unknown artefact manuscript is a little similar to the Books of Kells,  a relic of an important monastic settlement in Lorrha, Co. Tipperary. The purpose of this page is to tell the world,  display the beautiful penmanship  and the craftwork of the Reliquary and encourage people to visit the area where it was found. 

# Contact /Guided tour booking form

The contact/booking form iand useful to encourage including visits on a preplanned itinerary by tourist. This will improve the visitors experience and boost the economy of the local area.

# Form Destination page

This page loads when details are submitted in the contact form. It thanks the reader and promises to contact them soon.

# Footer

Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
The social media presence will help the user 
* to keep up to date with events happening around Lackeen Castle and the Stowe Missal. It will also encourage them 
* to connect with Lackeen Castle 
* provide testamonials - spread the word.
All links work.

# Future features 

* An online shopping page  for souvenirs, artwork and books and periodicals.
* Online booking with payment on booking for guided tours.
* Live streaming of talks given by local historical society and historical plays by local drama group.</li>
* O Kennedy family tree page/ clan reunion.
