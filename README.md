Wireframes

As I was not familiar enough with Balsamiq, I did not persist with  it in planning my project, but this project journey has tught me the value of planning with wireframes and I will do so in future and save a lot of time.

Site Structure

Lackeen Castle website has 5 pages. The <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/index.html)>home page</a> is the default landing page. The <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/castledef2.html)>castle defences,<a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/stowemissal.html)>Stowe Missal</a> and <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/contact.html)>Contact/guided tours pages are accessable from the navigation menu. There is also a <a url=(https://github.com/lastchancebar/lackeen-castle/blob/main/formdestination.html)>form destination/thank you</a> page which loads when the reader submits the contact/booking form.

I did not include a back to top arrow as I designed the website on a big screen and didnt realise the need for this aarrow until I was amending the dsign for a mobile phone screen where it is very necessary. 

Design choices

Typography
I chose fonts which conveyed history -'Eczar' for headings and 'PT+ Serif' for content, both on Google fonts which is shown at top of CSS file. Both fonts fall back to serif so they complement one another. As serif fonts it would not be difficult to substitute them in the event of one or both not being available .
 

 Colour Scheme

 I chose #00008b Navy blue for background to inspire history and learning.
 I chose Bisque - a warm cream-white, for text, a good contrast to the navy background.
 I also used a dark red with 0.7 opacity for information bubbles which were on top of images.
 Coral was used to highlight clicable links in content. It was a bit too bright but more visible thatn several yellows I tried.


 Navigation Menu


Sited at the top of all the pages in the site, it is nearly fully responsive and contains links to all  bar one of the pages of the site to enable ease of navigation in one convenient location.
