<h3>Stowe Missal</h3>
<p> The castle was refurbished again in the 18th century. A priceless family prayer book was found hidden in the castle wall. This manuscript, called the <em> Stowe Missal</em> is kept in the Royal Irish Academy and contains prayers, Gospels and cures for ailments! It has a spectacular cover box or <em>clúdach</em>.</p>
<h3>The O Kennedys</h3>
<p>The O'Kennedy's are significant on a world scale. They are descended from Cinn Éide, a nephew of Brian Ború, high king of Ireland
 (d.1014). They are ancestors of John F. Kennedy, 35th US president, who made a huge contribution to world history.</p>
